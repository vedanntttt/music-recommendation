## 📷 About Camera/Facial Detection

The camera button shows "Camera Unavailable" because:
1. **Browser permissions** - Camera access may be blocked
2. **DeepFace library** - Requires complex setup with TensorFlow models

**Recommendation**: Use the **Text Emotion Detection** feature instead - it works great!

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Text analysis not working?
- Check if emoji library is installed: `pip install "emoji<2.0.0"`
- Restart the Flask app

### Camera not working?
- This is expected - use Text Emotion Detection instead
- Camera requires browser permissions and additional DeepFace setup

### No playlists showing?
- Set up Spotify API credentials (see above)
- Without credentials, the app still detects emotions but won't show playlists
